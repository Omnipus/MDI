<p>The <strong>Magnum Development Index</strong> (MDI) is intended to be an informal way of measuring a country’s economic development and provides an indication of the scale and level of development between different countries. 
The index takes its name from Magnum® ice cream, a frozen ice cream desert from Unilever which is sold in various flavors throughout multiple countries.</p>

<p>What sounds more interesting? 
An economic development index based on abstract industrial output <em>yawn</em> or tasty Magnum ice cream!</p>

<a id="what-does-the-mdi-depict" class="anchor" href="#what-does-the-mdi-depict" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does the MDI depict?</h2>

<p>The MDI takes cues from the Economist’s Big Mac Index (BMI) in that it indicates a relative economic value of a country and allows comparison of each country on the index. But that is pretty much where the similarities end. </p>

<p>Unlike the BMI, the MDI does not have a quantitative fixing point (the BMI calculates a price in the respective country’s currency), but rather takes a number of criterion into account to give a final estimation. In addition, the MDI does not show the under/overvaluation of a currency, but gives an indication of a country’s economic development on a scale.
And now a few nerdy explanations:</p>

<p>To measure economic development, analysts have typically used the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (including its growth and per capita counterparts), Gross National Product (GNP), Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), poverty ratios and combined statistics such as the Human Development Index (HDI) (combination of life expectancy, education and income). 
These indicators have been very successful at gauging the development of a country, but there are so many that it may not always be easy to make conclusions. In addition, some very detailed indicators show development on the social side while economic indices tend to be a simple number. Thus there are not many ways of measuring the development based off of a country number like GDP since not every person produces goods (but almost every person has eaten ice cream). The Magnum index makes accurate conclusions on a country’s economic development. </p>

<h2>
<a id="how-is-the-mdi-calculated" class="anchor" href="#how-is-the-mdi-calculated" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is the MDI calculated?</h2>

<p>There are a number of factors that are taken into account when calculating the development of a country. This allows for the broadest range and the best placement of a country on the developing-developed scale. 
The main indicators are:
• The availability of Magnum ice cream: does the country sell magnum ice cream? Is it only available in imported food stores or is it widely available in most convenience stores?
• Price of the ice cream: what is the price in different locations, what is the average price?
• The choice of flavors: do consumers have a choice when it comes to ice cream flavors, or are they forced to eat the vanilla and chocolate covered Magnums (which are still very good)? How many flavors are there?
• The size of the magnum bar: surprisingly, not all Magnums are created equal, they can vary in sizes (we exclude specifically branded the “Magnum Mini”)
• The quality of the ice cream: at first, this may seem subjective, but the quality is not only based on taste (which is usually standard anyways i.e. vanilla is vanilla), it also accounts for the packaging, the condition at the Point of Sale (POS), the shape, the ice cream’s outside chocolate layer and last but not least, the wooden stick!</p>

<p>It may seem strange that one product offered by one company can explain a country’s economic development. But looking at the finer details shows that the Magnum ice cream bar has a powerful market force.</p>

<h3>
<a id="ice-cream-for-the-masses" class="anchor" href="#ice-cream-for-the-masses" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ice cream for the masses</h3>

<p>As a consumer product the Magnum ice cream is easily accessible, is typically not very expensive and has an appeal to both children and adults as a savory treat. Being one of the most successful brands of its parent Unilever, Magnum sales are large enough to consider the ice cream between a staple and a gourmet product. Just like the Big Mac, it can be easily found throughout the world. This makes comparing the product throughout the world relatively easy. </p>

<h3>
<a id="the-magnum-luxury" class="anchor" href="#the-magnum-luxury" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Magnum luxury</h3>

<p>Branding of the Magnum ice cream reveals a powerful message. The ice cream is shown as a luxury good, beautifully crafted and packaged, with good quality, taste and European heritage. Yet is it not only sold in 5 star restaurants or upscale food stores, it can be found in the most common of places. This means that it has good appeal and that when the ice cream is available in a certain country, it shows the existence of a healthy middle class (one of the most important aspects of a developed nation).</p>

<h3>
<a id="an-ice-creams-journey" class="anchor" href="#an-ice-creams-journey" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An ice cream’s journey</h3>

<p>What makes ice cream a good indicator is the fact that it must be stored in freezing conditions from the moment it is manufactured to the instant it is consumed. This requires good logistics and a developed infrastructure. It is not only up to the manufacturer to maintain the ice cream cold, stores who receive the goods must also maintain the product in ideal conditions all the way until the final sale to end users. This makes for a good item to compare for quality of infrastructure and non-company specific factors.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="global-embargo" class="anchor" href="#global-embargo" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Global embargo</h3>

<p>Continuing on the previous point, because ice cream is a difficult product to transport, it is usually not shipped between different countries as the risks of imperfect conditions and associated costs are high. That means that when a country sells Magnum ice creams, they are most likely produced in the same country. This makes evaluation of a single country efficient and accurate.</p>

<h3>
<a id="cool-treat-in-a-hot-place" class="anchor" href="#cool-treat-in-a-hot-place" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cool treat in a hot place</h3>

<p>Based on other economic indicators, it has been found that countries closer to the equator tend to be less developed. Based on the sun’s existence, it has been found that countries which are closer to the equator tend to be hotter. Since ice cream and heat do not mix very well, this means that if a country close to the equator with hot weather sells Magnum ice cream it must be rather developed. This makes evaluating countries which are developing easier to distinguish from those that are not developing.</p>

<h3>
<a id="simply-straightforward" class="anchor" href="#simply-straightforward" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simply straightforward</h3>

<p>One product, one metric. We look at Magnum ice cream, not all ice cream. Evaluating a country based off of one product allows for comparison and it also makes it easier to conduct evaluations over a larger number of countries. </p>

<h3>
<a id="buy-it-here-and-everywhere" class="anchor" href="#buy-it-here-and-everywhere" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Buy it here… and everywhere</h3>

<p>As per Unilever’s financial statements, “You can now buy Magnum in more than 40 countries, including the Philippines, Pakistan and Thailand, following the 2012 roll-out of the brand in these countries,” that means building an index is relatively easy (the BMI has 48 countries+ EU zone). The Magnum ice cream does not include any ingredients that are considered by countries to be against their religion or other cultural values. 
In summary, the MDI includes a country’s population demographics, purchasing power, infrastructure and market conditions, all packaged in one single tasty treat. Just about the only thing it doesn’t include is a country’s political situation, which, for an economic index is perfect.</p>

<h3>
<a id="one-company-show" class="anchor" href="#one-company-show" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One company show</h3>

<p>Magnum is produced by Unilever, a British company. Their products are similar in shape and style but have varying flavors. Does this mean that it is biased? Yes and no. Yes, because we only evaluate one product and this takes into account the marketing, expansion and business strategy of only one company. Unilever makes sure to do thorough market research and due diligence before implementing million-dollar facilities to produce and ship the product; if they do it, it’s for a reason. They are also the only ones to set the base prices for the ice cream. But this is not necessarily bad. If a large company like Unilever decides to sell ice cream in one country it means there is a customer base and they have the physical capabilities of sales. The Big Mac index also only looks at one product, that’s the beauty of the index.</p>

<p>Yes ice cream is not for everyone. Some countries, such as China, did not consume dairy products until recently. Other countries don’t have the culture and habit of eating ice cream. Nevertheless, there tends to be quite a large amount of people who enjoy frozen ice cream regardless of the weather.</p>

<h3>
<a id="brother-from-another-mother" class="anchor" href="#brother-from-another-mother" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brother from another mother</h3>

<p>Why do we look at ice cream and not another product? Why only Magnum and not other brands? It’s true that other products could be used to gauge development (we can think of Ferrero Rocher chocolates, Lays potato chips, Coca cola…etc). But there are certain elements inherent in Magnum ice cream that makes it more relevant: it is hard to transport/keep in good condition, it has little competition in its market segment, it is a “cheap luxury”, it varies slightly (which gives a better range of development based on the variations), it appeals to a wide range of consumers, it is not an everyday product. Unilever also produces the Cornetto® ice cream (also world renown), but it tends to be catering to lower market segments and is not pure ice cream (it also includes a cone, many different flavoring syrups and occasional toppings which makes comparison more difficult). The Magnum bar is also the world’s best-selling ice cream bar.</p>
